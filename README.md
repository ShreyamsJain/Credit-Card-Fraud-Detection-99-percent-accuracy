● Transformed data to contain numeric values by oversampling using RandomOverSampler, Python, NumPy,
Pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, SMOTE to create resampled dataset of 500,000 rows.
● Evaluated algorithms for accuracy - chose best 2 algorithms, scaled and estimated accuracy using metrics such
as accuracy score, classification report, achieving accuracy of 99.99% with precision, recall and f score of 1.0.
